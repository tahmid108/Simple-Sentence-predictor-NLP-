# Simple-Sentence-predictor-NLP-
This is a simple n-gram modelling project. By using your desired corpus you can predict your sentences using bi-gram and
tri-gram modelling.

For each input it generates a probability of the next possible words. Thus you can predict your sentence easily.
This mini project is done using C++.
